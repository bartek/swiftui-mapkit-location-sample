# swiftui-mapkit-location-sample

A sample application leveraging MapKit to display a map, identify user
coordinates (with expected authorization) and allow the search and placement of
points of interest on the map.

This was built in an effort to gain a better understanding of MapKit and will
likely see refinement and additions as I increase my understanding.
